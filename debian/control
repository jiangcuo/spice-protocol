Description: SPICE protocol headers
 The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) 
 is a remote display system built for virtual environments which
 allows you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on
 the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet
 and from a wide variety of machine architectures. 
 .
 This package provides headers defining protocols.
